        <h1>Her House of Cards</h1>
        <p>How did a 26-year-old cocktail waitress end up running a private weekly poker game for some of Hollywood’s highest rollers, including the likes of Leo, Ben, and Tobey? In an adaptation from her new memoir, Molly Bloom, who has since gained notoriety as “the Poker Princess,” recalls her lucky break, at the infamous Viper Room; the millions that crossed her table; and the biggest winners—who could also be the worst losers.</p>

        <p className="content">
            At 6:45 P.M. I stood by the front door and waited. I fidgeted with my dress. I started to feel insecure about how to greet the players. I knew their names, but did that mean that I should introduce myself?</p>
        <p className="content">
            Stop it, I said in my head. I closed my eyes and tried to calm down by imagining myself as I wanted to be—not the Colorado girl scraping by as a cocktail waitress. My boss, Reardon, a real-estate investor, had decided I would be the hostess of a poker game he had organized at Hollywood’s infamous Viper Room.</p>
        <p className="content">
            “Molly Bloom, you are wearing the dress of your dreams. You are confident and fearless and you will be perfect.” None of this was true, of course, but I wanted it to be. I opened my eyes, lifted my chin, and relaxed my shoulders. It was showtime.
        </p>
        <p className="content">The first person to arrive was Todd, the famous writer and director.</p>
        <p className="content">“Hello,” I said, warmly reaching out my hand. “I’m Molly Bloom.” I gave him a genuine smile.</p>
        <p className="content">“Hi, gorgeous, I’m Todd—nice to meet you in person.</p>
        <p className="content">“Do I give the buy-in to you?” he asked.</p>
        <p className="content">“Sure,” I said, eyeing the giant stack of hundred-dollar bills.</p>
        <p className="content">“Can I get you a drink?” I asked.</p>
        <p className="content">He ordered a Diet Coke. I went behind the bar and set the enormous amount of money down.</p>
        <p className="content">After I served him his drink, I started counting the stack. It was $10,000, all right. I put it in the cash register with Todd’s name on it. I felt cool, edgy, and dangerous counting that much money. The others started to arrive.</p>
        <p className="content">Bruce introduced himself and handed me his buy-in as well. I knew from my research that he had been an executive at of one of the most prestigious golf companies in the world. Bob was a real-estate magnate, and Phillip came from a long line of European aristocrats. His mother had been a glamorous supermodel and his father was one of the most famous playboys in Manhattan. Reardon came blasting in with his typical “Oh yeah!” greeting. The rumpled Houston showed up next, followed by Tobey and Leo. I straightened my shoulders and smiled as naturally as I could. They are just people, I told myself as butterflies flew manically around in my stomach. I introduced myself, took their buy-ins, and asked for their drink orders. When I shook Leo’s hand and he gave me a crooked smile from under his hat, my heart raced a little faster. Tobey was cute, too, and he seemed very friendly. I didn’t have any backstory on Houston except that he was somehow involved in the movie business. He had kind eyes, but there was something different about him. He didn’t seem to belong with this crowd. Steve, a major Hollywood director, and Dylan, a producer, showed up next.</p>
        <p className="content">The energy in the room was palpable. It felt more like a sports arena than the basement of the Viper Room.</p>
        <p className="content">Reardon finished ripping into a sandwich and shouted, “Let’s play.”</p>
        <p className="content">I watched, fascinated. It was all incredibly surreal. I was standing in the corner of the Viper Room counting ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH! I was in the company of movie stars, important directors, and powerful business tycoons. I felt like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole.</p>
        <p className="content">As the players filed out, they thanked me, some kissed my cheek, but they all pressed bills into my hand. I smiled warmly and thanked them in return, trying not to let my hands shake.</p>
        <p className="content">When they were all gone, I sat down in a daze, and with trembling hands I counted $3,000.</p>
