Hello to everyone and, honestly, I'm not in the mood to make a more elaborate introduction; so let's go to the naked news: The blog will stop for an indefinite time.

I was already having difficulties to continue working on the blog, so much so that most of the posts were from Na. However, because of the 10 years of the blog, I tried a little harder to make this year count.

However, a horrible thing happened to me, I was fired!
Don't need to panic, it was dismissal without cause, so I took my termination, part of my FGTS and Unemployment Insurance. Keeping me won't be a problem.

What will be impossible to maintain on the other hand, are the blog projects. The video of Face Reveal, a mega fanart contest in the middle of the year and much more, were ideas that came from my pocket. And at the moment, I'm going to have to prioritize those gains on more important goals. Improve myself, run after another job, take exams, anything that gets me out of this situation." photourl="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFyhYDrYvJtzuSy2BlcTY8accr8KSNSDbQGu_fLMGTDp9mnyJ2CDcZkdhSMyaK02vcWsiCJ4kNh6YuPv35LaoRoLExCDgsiu-_DcOG216QhK5t-vjtiv984KvaGNGMwGa4SFZUxJ8qR5g8l4eODChjMOae2IWQT49ChcIk5bMosN0K1FI8zvcvje3FVnsf/w640-h360/imagem_2025-04-25_203819327.png" link="https://mylittleponybrasill.blogspot.com/2025/04/mais-um-hiato-pro-blog.html" />
